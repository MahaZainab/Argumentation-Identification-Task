editing in the rest pose will influence most other poses,background_claim
SSD is also notorious for artifacts at rotating elbows and extreme poses,background_claim
Example based skinning methods such as Pose Space Deformation (PSD) are candidates for correcting SSD limitations,background_claim
PSD may be used as a compensation to the underlying SSD,background_claim
the animator specifies the PSD examples after the SSD has been performed,background_claim
"the examples are best interpolated in the rest pose, before the SSD has been applied",background_claim
the action of the SSD and any other deformations must be “inverted” in order to push the example compensation before these operations,background_claim

SSD is very popular in circumstances that require animating a number of characters in real time,background_claim
vertex transformations can be easily implemented in the graphic card,data
the domain of adjusting one vertex in this way is strictly limited to the linear subspace formed by the vertex as transformed by joints influencing this vertex,background_claim

the reason why the inverse should be performed is still ambiguous,own_claim
inverting the SSD (and other deformations) in order to interpolate the examples in the rest pose is a the right choice,own_claim
it is an improvement,own_claim
the superiority of the inverse method,own_claim
SSD −1 simply is the inverse transformation matrix generated by SSD,own_claim
SSD is a 3D transformation,data
the inverse method is superior,own_claim
Taking the model in rest pose as an example is a common practice when applying shape interpolation,background_claim
interpolating effects from other examples should not change the original model in rest pose,background_claim
"we have: ω 1x = φ 11 −1 d 1x + φ 12 −1 d 2x = φ 12 −1 d 2x ω 2x = φ 21 −1 d 1x + φ 22 −1 d 2x = φ 22 −1 d 2x = d 2x ω 1y = φ 11 −1 d 1y + φ 12 −1 d 2y = φ 12 −1 d 2y ω 2y = φ 21 −1 d 1y + φ 22 −1 d 2y = φ 22 −1 d 2y = d 2y where φ i −1 j is the (i, j)th element of Φ −1",own_claim
we simplify SSD as a rotation transformation ignoring other issues such as accumulating effects from the first joint,own_claim
only the second joint is rotating,own_claim
"in forward case, the direction of deformed vertex always keeps the same with the example cylinder",own_claim
( figure 4 ),data
"For inverse PSD however, that direction is changed along with the rotation of the joint",own_claim
PSD is supposed to be a method as “local” correction,own_claim
pose space should not be extended to a whole space that has to incorporate all influenced objects,own_claim
a matter of experience,data
large amount of unnecessary works of building examples will be required,own_claim
the distance between different poses is also meaningless,own_claim
most of which have been implemented in most animation packages,background_claim
"in many circumstances, other deformation schemes will be adopted",background_claim

[ 9 ],data
we can deform the original character model from rest pose to another specific pose,own_claim
One advantage of Powell’s classic method is that it does not need explicit computation of the function’s gradient,background_claim
[ 12 ],data
Powell’s method is suitable,own_claim
"we are treating the skinning operations as a “black box”, their gradient is not available",data
"after repeated cycles of M line minimizations on conjugate directions, the optimization will in due course converge to the minimum",background_claim
[ 12 ],data
"If the SSD transformation in equation 1 is singular, some types of inverse PSD deformation will not be possible",own_claim
any component of the desired deformation that lies in the null space of the SSD matrix will be ignored,data
singular cases are rare,own_claim
it is possible to handle these cases with a small rearrangement of the inverse PSD approach,own_claim
"one example is a joint with 180 o rotation and equal 2 1 , 2 1 weights on the two joint frames, which is an unrealistic case of selfintersection",data
it will be generally be zero,own_claim
w i is being minimized,data
will be non-zero only if it is not possible to obtain the desired deformation v i using SKINNING i (v r + d i ),own_claim
Inverse skinning integrates SSD and shape interpolation more firmly than its forward rival.,own_claim
the inverse approach presents better performance and more consistent interpolation,own_claim
Figure 7 to Figure 10,data
"the direction of deformed vertex in inverse skinning is linearly proportional to joint rotations in a simplified example, while the forward PSD does not incorporate the direction information",own_claim
the minimizing process will introduce more cost,own_claim
The cost of the inverse operation is not critical,own_claim
it is a one time “setup” cost,own_claim
the compute time is insignificant compared to the human time required to sculpt the desired deformations,own_claim
a frame goes wrong,data
physical principles,data
the model is very detailed,data
playback of animation becomes quite heavy and time consuming,data
For those applications that require visual fidelity,background_claim
SSD serves only as a basic framework,background_claim

"Besides SSD, other skinning approaches",background_claim
can also be applied,background_claim

physical modelling and animation is another field providing realistic character simulations,background_claim
Simpler parametric skinning approaches (of which SSD is the prototype) have a fixed number of parameters,background_claim
the direction of deformed vertices from inverse skinning is a linear function of joint rotation,own_claim
"in the forward approach, that direction is kept as a constant",own_claim
propose a unified framework which can be implemented on high-end commercial packages while allowing any proprietary skinning operators to be incorporated,own_claim
Skeleton Subspace Deformation (SSD) is a basic algorithm that is used to define how the character surface deforms following movements of its underlying skeletons,background_claim
[ 11 ],data
SSD is adopted to define this relation,data
"each vertex or control point of the character surface is provided with a list of joints, that will influence it, along with the weight indicating the amount of influence",background_claim
the position of a vertex in the animated pose is the result of weighted linear blending of its transformation by each associated joint,background_claim
the character is animated,data
The famous SSD problem of “collapsed elbow”,background_claim
sculpted in N example poses,data
a vertex v,data
"there are N delta d i , i = 0, . . . , N − 1 corresponding to each pose x i , i = 0, . . . , N − 1",own_claim
SSD as the underlying skinning,own_claim
an explicit form of basic skinning can help to simplify our task of explanation,own_claim
"in the rest pose, we didn’t generate any movement for v",data
"d 1 = [d 1x , d 1y ] = [0, 0]",own_claim
by solving above equation,data
i = j,data
φ i −1 j = 1,own_claim
"this angle α p is a constant and depends only on the value of delta in the second pose d 2 = [d 2x , d 2y ]",own_claim
tan α p = d d x y = ω ω 1x 1y φ φ (x (x − − x x 1 1 ) ) + + ω ω 2y 2x φ φ (x (x − − x x 2 2 ) ) = φ φ 12 12 −1 −1 d d 2x 2y φ φ (x (x − − x x 1 1 ) ) + + d d 2x 2y φ φ (x (x − − x x 2 2 ) ) = d 2y d 2x,own_claim
tan α p = d d x y,own_claim
The case described above is quite common in practice,own_claim
"animating shoulder, elbow, knee, hip-bone, neck",data
All these parts would rotate from the rest pose with some angle to other poses,own_claim
a unified framework in which no explicit inverse operation is necessitated,own_claim
a basic skinning method supported by animation packages,data
v i t = v i + d i = SKINNING i (v r ) + d i,own_claim
we need to replace SSD with SKINNING in the inverse skinning algorithm as such for equation 4,own_claim
the more general case,data
To find delta d i in the rest pose: v i = SKINNING i (v r ) + d i = SKINNING i (v r + d i ) we can setup a minimization problem to minimize the function,own_claim
This function can be given to Powell’s method to find d i at the minimum of f (d ),own_claim
"For each example pose P i , we have a d i",data
we can apply radial basis function to d i (i = 0 . . . n − 1) in pose space to obtain ω i (i = 0 . . . n − 1),own_claim
Minimizing the function f (d ) in a particular direction is actually minimization problem of one variable,own_claim
Powell’s idea is trying to find each minimum of function f (d ) in different direction until f (d ) stops decreasing,background_claim
How to choose the next direction is the main concern of Powell’s method,background_claim
"In Maya, “tweaking” is a procedure adding delta values to original surface vertices before any deformations",background_claim
It is actu- ally Maya’s form of rest-pose editing for their built-in deformation operators,background_claim
the whole system is divided into two phases,own_claim
Figure 6,data
The first phase is to find each delta in the rest pose corresponding to each example pose,own_claim
the second phase that is a linear system performing RBF interpolation to obtain the PSD weights,own_claim
only minimal code changed are required,own_claim
The final synthesis is then v x = SKINNING(v r + d x ) + w x where w x is interpolated after SKINNING by applying the same RBF scheme as used for d x,own_claim
the SSD transform is nearsingular,data
"the solved d i can be much large than other d k , which can result in poorly posed interpolation",own_claim
the synthesis is potentially realtime,own_claim
no extra computing is involved in this process,own_claim
the linear system is solved,data
only one joint rotation and two example poses are considered,data
A nice review of SSD is given,background_claim
